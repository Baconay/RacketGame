README

In this game there are five rooms that you can enter. Your goal is to reach the final room and open the Winner's Chest. To do so, you must find a way to destroy 
the barricades that block your way (such as creating a tool to do so). You can use the (help) command to view all commands in the game. In the event that you die,
the game will restart and you will be sent back to the starting room.
